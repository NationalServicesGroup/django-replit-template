## For the Interviewer

### Getting Started with Replit

To get started, navigate to [Replit](https://replit.com/) and create an account.

Once signed up, youâ€™ll be taken to the dashboard where you can create a new application.

Create an application by selecting the plus icon as shown in the screenshot below.

After clicking on the plus sign, a modal will appear where you can "Import from GitHub", where you will enter `https://github.com/NationalServicesGroup/django-replit-template.git` as the URL to import.

When you click "Run" at the top of the screen, it will install the needed packages / libraries, and start the Django application.  Under the hood, Replit is configured to run `python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:3000` when you click run.  And port `3000` has been mapped to port `80` for the environment.

![Run](docs/img/application_started.png)

There is an option to get a shell in the bottom frame, from which you can run command like `python manage.py migrate`. 

When done, click on the `django-replit-template` name in the top left, then click the three vertical dots, and then click "Delete".
